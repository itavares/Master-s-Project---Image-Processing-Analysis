# Image Processing Analysis - Master's Project
These scripts are part of Ighor Tavares Master's Project, Spy Camera identification with Image Processing Analysis. 

# Usage:

The main script executes both dynamic and static image processing analysis. The scrip can be used through the command line using the format :

		bash ./run.sh  <output name> 

Alternatively, you can manually run each individual script through the command line using the formats:
		
		python motion_detector.py [-h] [-o OUTPUT]
		python static_ana.py [-h] [-i INPUT]
